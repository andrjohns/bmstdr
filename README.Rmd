# Introduction: 

 This is the github page for the `R` package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("bmstdr")`. This is the companion `R` package for the book  <a href="https://www.sujitsahu.com/bookbmstdr/">Bayesian Modeling of Spatio-Temporal Data with R </a> published by Chapman and Hall.   
 <p> 
 The package facilitates Bayesian modeling of both point referenced and areal unit data with or without temporal replications. Three main functions in the package: `Bspatial` for spatial only point referenced data,   `Bsptime` for spatio-temporal point reference data  and `Bcartime` for  areal unit data,  which may also vary in time,  perform the main modeling and validation tasks. Computations and inference in a Bayesian modeling framework   are done using popular `R` software packages such as `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("spBayes")`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("spTimer")`,  `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("spTDyn")`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("CARBayes")`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("CARBayesST")` and also code written using computing platforms  `r BiocStyle::Rpackage("INLA")` and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("rstan")`. 
 
 <p> 
 
  Point referenced data are modeled using the Gaussian error distribution only but a top level  generalized linear model is used for areal data modeling. The user of `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("bmstdr")` is afforded the flexibility to choose an appropriate package and is also free to name the rows of their input data frame for validation  purposes. The package  incorporates a range of prior distributions allowable in the nominated  packages with default hyper-parameter values.   The package allows quick comparison of models using both model choice criteria,  such as DIC  and WAIC,  and facilitates K-fold cross-validation without much programming effort. Familiar diagnostic plots and model fit exploration using the S3 methods such as  `summary`, `residuals` and `plot` are included so that a beginner user  confident in model fitting using the base `R` function  `lm` can quickly learn to analyzing data by fitting  a range of appropriate spatial and spatio-temporal models.  <a href="https://www.sujitsahu.com/bmbook/bmstdr-full_vignette.html"> The full vignette </a> illustrates the package using five built-in data sets.  Three of these are on point referenced data on air pollution and temperature at the deep ocean,  and the other two are areal unit data on Covid-19 mortality in England.
